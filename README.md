# Petty Cash Quest
A text-adventure and turn-based combat role playing game that uses vanilla ReactJS. A player can create a character and embark on a noble quest across a fantasy universe to regain $14 loaned to an old nemesis. Character creation and player HUD 
was developed by [Sean McNeely](https://github.com/sean21mcn), the items menu and item
functionality was developed by [Mikhail Misenas](https://github.com/mistermappy), and I developed the story, gameplay mechanics and turn-based combat.
